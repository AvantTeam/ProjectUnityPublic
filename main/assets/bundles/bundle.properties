## Koruh Items
item.unity-stone.name = Stone
item.unity-stone.description = Hard and moderately dense resource, abundant in the outer crust.
item.unity-stone.details = Stone seems resistant to spores. However, the traces of stone found deeper down, formed long ago, is not, although being much softer and more versatile.
item.unity-steel.name = Steel
item.unity-steel.description = Hard, tempered metal. It effectively holds experience, and is highly resistant to corrosion.
item.unity-dense-alloy.name = Dense Alloy
item.unity-dense-alloy.description = Basic alloy of copper and lead. Has high density, hence its name.
item.unity-dense-alloy.details = Since lead and copper usually do not mix, it needs to be processed under very high heat and pressure. No current technology can withstand this, despite traces of dense alloy being found in ancient ruins.
item.unity-dirium.name = Dirium
item.unity-dirium.description = A complex alloy consisting of many elements. It is a great conductor of experience, and can recreate many unnatural behaviors when infused with experience.
item.unity-dirium.details = It is unclear if this dirium is identical to the "dirium" mentioned in ancient recordings. However, since it can replicate many of the claims of this material, such as being able to teleport matter, it wouldn't be far apart, chemically. The irony is that this material shouldn't exist, chemically.

# Liquids
liquid.unity-lava.name = Lava
liquid.unity-lava.description = Molten stone, very hot. Handle with care and caution.

# Koruh Blocks
## Crafters
block.unity-liquifier.name = Liquifier

block.unity-steel-smelter.name = Smelter
block.unity-steel-smelter.description = Smelts dense alloy and condensed carbon into steel, using coal as fuel. Despite being simple, it is very inefficient.
block.unity-dense-smelter.name = Furnace
block.unity-dense-smelter.description = Burns copper and lead under high heat to produce dense alloy. Without experience, it cannot withstand the heat, causing it to slowly lose health.
block.unity-steel-smelter.details = Even though this factory was recreated using the blueprints recovered from the ruins, its efficiency is much less than expected. Either the elements are actually isotopes which have fully decayed since, or the blueprint is omitting something crucial.
block.unity-lava-smelter.name = Lava Smelter
block.unity-lava-smelter.description = An advanced smelter, smelts dense alloy and condensed carbon into steel with lava. It can only withstand the high temperatures of lava smelting using experience, and will melt instantly if experience is insufficient.
block.unity-lava-smelter.details = This iteration of the smelter is much more efficient for some unknown reason. The prevailing theory is that what we now call "experience" was actually prevalent and in the atmosphere of ancient times, breathing life into the unscientific designs.
block.unity-dirium-crucible.name = Crucible
block.unity-dirium-crucible.description = Infuses heavy metals with intense heat and experience to forge dirium.\nProcessors are advised to prevent clogging, as this block only has 4 sides.
block.unity-dirium-crucible.details = From legends and ancient tales to the incomplete translations of the ruins, the material "dirium" was mentioned as a wildcard material used for any magical property. After countless trials and errors, this rather odd combination of rare metals seemed to produce what best fit the description of "dirium".
block.unity-coal-extractor.name = Coal Extractor
block.unity-coal-extractor.description = Extracts coal from large amounts of stone using water. It doesn't take damage for not having enough experience, but without having enough experience, it does not extract coal.=

block.unity-titanium-extractor.name = Titanium Extractor
block.unity-titanium-extractor.description = Extracts titanium from steel and dense alloy.
block.unity.titanium-extractor.details =

block.unity-fractal-laser-turret.description =
block.unity-bt-laser-turret.name = Laser T-Breakthrough
block.unity-bt-laser-turret.description =
block.unity-inferno.name = Inferno
block.unity-inferno.description = An upgrade from scorch.

## Walls
block.unity-steel-wall.name = Steel Wall
block.unity-steel-wall.description = A dense and durable wall. The density of the material gives it even higher resistance to high-energy blows.
block.unity-steel-wall-large.name = Large Steel Wall
block.unity-steel-wall-large.description = A dense and durable wall. The density of the material gives it even higher resistance to high-energy blows. Spans multiple tiles.
block.unity-ustone-wall.name = Stone Wall
block.unity-ustone-wall.description = A simple, cheap wall. It crumbles easily, but the stone it is composed of is surprisingly durable, withstanding even the strongest blows. Therefore, it has the interesting behavior of withstanding single blows which would crumble this block when dealt over time.
block.unity-dense-wall.name = Dense Wall
block.unity-dense-wall.description = A slightly more dense and durable wall. The density of the material gives it high resistance to high-energy blows.
block.unity-dirium-wall.name = Dirium Wall
block.unity-dirium-wall.description = A highly durable wall with interesting properties. The durability of the material gives it high resistance to high-energy blows, and it appears to resist taking damage for some time after it has taken a blow.
block.unity-dirium-wall-large.name = Large Dirium Wall
block.unity-dirium-wall-large.description = A highly durable wall with interesting properties. The durability of the material gives it high resistance to high-energy blows, and it appears to resist taking damage for some time after it has taken a blow. Spans multiple tiles.

block.unity-exp-router.description = Distributes experience orbs to adjacent tiles. Lets items pass in a straight line.
block.unity-exp-router.details = Lost the functionality to route items long ago, just passing them through. It can route [#84ff00]something else[], however...
block.unity-exp-tower.name = Ancient Tower
block.unity-exp-tower.description = Sends experience to another block in front.
block.unity-exp-tower.details = Lost the functionality to send power long ago. It can send [#84ff00]something else[], though...
block.unity-diagonal-tower.name = Steel Tower
block.unity-diagonal-tower.description = Sends experience to another block in front. Can be configured to send experience diagonally.
block.unity-buffer-tower.name = Armored Tower
block.unity-buffer-tower.description = Sends experience to another block in front. Has higher health, but also a short delay before sending as well as a capped throughput. Useful for limiting the rate of experience, or logic gates.
